We have already covered this in the second lesson, but as an easy recap try to code a counter in Javascript It should go up as time goes by in intervals of 1 second.

//Iniialize a counter variable
let counter = 0;

//Function to Update and display the counter
function updateCounter() {

//increment the counter by 1
counter++;

// Display the updated counter value
  console.log("Counter:", counter);
}

// Set an interval to call the updateCounter function every second
setInterval(updateCounter, 1000);
