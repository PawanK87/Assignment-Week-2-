Write to a file
Using the fs library again, try to write to the contents of a file. You can use the fs library to as a black box, the goal is to understand async tasks.

const fs = require('fs');

// Function to write data to a file
function writeToFile(filename, data) {
  // Write the data to the file asynchronously
  fs.writeFile(filename, data, 'utf8', (err) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error writing to file:', err);
      return;
    }
    console.log('Data has been written to', filename);
  });
}

// Example usage: Write "Hello, World!" to a file named "output.txt"
writeToFile('output.txt', 'Hello, World!');
